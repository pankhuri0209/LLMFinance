The Gujarat high court has permitted a 20-year-old woman
to continue living with her 19-year-old live-in partner, who
is not of marriageable age yet. On Wednesday, the couple
reunited after the HC ruled that the woman is a not a minor
and she may stay with who she likes in accordance with law
and propriety. The state government also assured the court
that police would escort her to the place where she wanted
to stay. The woman’s partner had approached the high court
on July 19, filing a habeas corpus petition on basis of a
“friendship” contract defining their live-in relationship. He
had argued that his girlfriend should be brought before the
court because she was being forcibly kept away from him.
The petitioner had contended that since he was not of
marriageable age he could not legally marry her. Therefore,
they decided to live together and signed a contract about
their live-in relationship. They had also got the document
notarized. The petitioner relied on the friendship contract
because it reflected the wish of his partner that she was
willing to stay with him. He also told the HC that like many
inter-caste relationships, the family members interfered in
his case. They were tracked down by the girl’s family
members when they eloped for nearly 10 days in June.
Upon hearing the plea, the HC ordered Surendranagar
district police to bring the girl before the court. The HC also
ordered police to come with a report detailing the action
taken for searching for the girl if they failed to secure her
presence before the court. On Wednesday, cops brought the
girl from her mother’s place. When the HC asked her to
express her wish, she unequivocally expressed her desire
that she would not like to live with her mother and relatives.
